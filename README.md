IREvaluation
============

IR evaluation tool

Performing Evluationin IR is a bit difficult-
When Multiple Systems Output is to be compared single metric does not convey complete information about the ranked results.
Different metrics for comparison makes evaluation complex. A single system performing good across all metrics makes the problem simpler but majority of the times the situation is otherwise. 

Comparing the incremental growth of own system is complex. Comparing against own previous results where the results varies by changing ranking, retrieval models and other query formulation techniques is a bit tricky. Hard to determine the statistical significance

Our tool presents a visual representation of the output of different systems.
Instead of the matrix of numbers(complex to read and interpret) we have the graphical representation of how the results are varying-
While changing/selecting different parameters such as evaluation  metric, averaged or query based representation.
